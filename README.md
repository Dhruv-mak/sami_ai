SAMI AI is an intelligent assistant designed to help mass spectrometry experts and biochemical researchers analyze complex datasets without writing code. Through a natural language chat interface, users can perform data analysis, visualization, and interpretation.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Communicate with SAMI AI using simple English commands
- **Data Processing**: Load and normalize CSV data files from various omics experiments
- **Visualization**: Generate plots and visual representations of molecules across samples
- **Marker Analysis**: Find significant markers that differentiate between clusters or regions
- **Clustering**: Perform clustering and other statistical analyses on biochemical data
- **Pipeline Creation**: Build and execute analysis workflows for repeated tasks
- **Multi-omics Support**: Work with metabolomics, lipidomics, glycomics and other data types

## Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sami_ai.git
   cd sami_ai
   ```

2. Build and run with Docker:
   ```
   docker build -t sami-ai .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 -it sami-ai
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000

### Local Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.13+ and [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed

2. Clone and set up the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sami_ai.git
   cd sami_ai
   uv sync
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Start the Chainlit server:
   ```
   chainlit run main.py
   ```
