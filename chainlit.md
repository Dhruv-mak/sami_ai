# Welcome to SAMI AI - Your Biochemical Data Analysis Assistant! 🧪🔬🤖

Hello Mass Spec Explorer! 👋 

SAMI AI is here to help you analyze your biochemical data without writing a single line of code! Simply chat with me as you would with a colleague, and I'll handle the technical aspects of data processing and visualization for you.

**Quick heads up**: I've been designed with a focused set of functions to make sure I pick the right tool for your job every time. Think of it like having a well-organized lab bench - fewer tools means less confusion! 🧰

**Fair warning**: Some features might be a bit temperamental (we're still teaching them proper lab etiquette). Please be patient if things don't work perfectly on the first try! 🔬

## What can I do for you? 🌟

- 📊 **Load and normalize** your CSV data files
    
    **Smart data detection**: I'm pretty good at guessing what type of data you have! If your column names start with 'g', I'll assume it's glycomics data. If they start with 'L' or 'P', that's lipidomics territory. Everything else gets the metabolomics treatment. This saves you from having to tell me what kind of data you're working with (because who has time for that?). Let me know in the feedback if you prefer to specify the data type explicitly!

- 📈 **Cluster your data** 
    
    **What I need to know**: For clustering to work its magic, please mention:
    - The **modality** (metabolomics/lipidomics/glycomics)
    - The **region** you want to analyze
    - You can cluster all tissues at once if you're feeling ambitious!
    - Multiple regions are fine, but they need the same modality (no mixing and matching allowed!)

- 🤝 **Cluster Integration** 
    
    **Why this matters**: If you want cluster regions to actually make sense together (like making sure pink/cluster 1 represents the same morphological region across datasets), integration is your friend! Think of it as making sure your data speaks the same language.

- 🔍 **Find markers** for different clusters or regions
    
    **Important note**: When asking for markers, please tell me which clustering result you want them for. I'm good, but I'm not psychic! 🔮

- 🧬 **Pathway analyses** 
    
    **Heads up**: You'll need to specify which clustering result you want the markers file generated from. Otherwise, I might get confused about which data you're referring to.

- 📈 **Pathway visualization** 
    
    **Be specific**: Mention the specific cluster you want visualized. Otherwise, you might get a visualization of... well, everything, which probably isn't what you're after!

## How to use this chat interface 💬

1. **Type your question or request** in the message box at the bottom of the screen
